TERRAFORM PLAN - NOT EXECUTED

Status: BLOCKED
Reason: Terraform init failed due to missing RBAC permissions (see terraform_validate.txt)

Cannot generate plan until:
1. RBAC roles are assigned to service principal 750452fa-c519-455f-b77d-18f9707e2f39
2. Terraform init succeeds with Azure AD authentication

See OIDC-SETUP.md for required role assignment commands.
