TERRAFORM VALIDATION - BLOCKED

Status: FAILED
Reason: Unable to initialize Terraform backend due to missing RBAC permissions

Error Details:
- Terraform init requires Storage Blob Data Contributor role on stvrdtfstateeus201
- Role assignment commands failed with: MissingSubscription error
- This appears to be a subscription context issue in the Azure CLI session

Required Actions:
1. Complete RBAC role assignments from OIDC-SETUP.md:
   - Assign Reader role at subscription scope to service principal
   - Assign Storage Blob Data Contributor role on tfstate storage account

2. After roles are assigned, run:
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform init -reconfigure
   terraform validate
   terraform plan -var-file=../../environments/dev.tfvars

Current State:
- ✅ Terraform backend configuration: CORRECT (use_azuread_auth = true)
- ✅ Terraform code formatting: PASS (terraform fmt applied)
- ✅ Backend storage created: PASS (rg + storage account + container exist)
- ❌ Backend permissions: FAILED (RBAC assignments incomplete)
- ❌ Terraform init: BLOCKED (cannot proceed without permissions)
- ❌ Terraform validate: BLOCKED
- ❌ Terraform plan: BLOCKED

Next Step:
Run the role assignment commands manually from OIDC-SETUP.md, then retry validation.
